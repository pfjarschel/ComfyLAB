## 1. Introduction & Philosophy

### 1.1 What is ComfyLAB?
**ComfyLAB** (**Comf**ortable **L**ab **A**utomation **B**locks) is an open-source, visual programming platform engineered specifically for scientific experiment automation, test & measurement, data acquisition (DAQ), and real-time visualization.

In modern research laboratories, automated measurement setups often require interfacing with diverse hardware (oscilloscopes, power supplies, multimeters, function generators, custom sensors) via various protocols (VISA, SCPI, Serial RS-232/RS-485, Ethernet, native C/C++ DLLs). Writing raw script-based automation in traditional languages frequently results in verbose, repetitive boilerplate code for loop management, thread safety, exception handling, data parsing, and GUI rendering.

ComfyLAB resolves this by providing a clean, modular graphical interface where users drag functional **Blocks** onto a digital canvas, connect them with visual **Wires**, and organize results into an instant, interactive **Dashboard**.

---

### 1.2 Dual Architecture: Web UI + Python Server Engine
ComfyLAB operates on a decoupled client-server model separating user interaction from backend execution and hardware communication:

| Layer | Primary Role | Key Capabilities | Stack |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Front-End UI** | User Interaction | • Infinite canvas with drag-and-drop wiring<br>• Dedicated Operator Dashboard cockpit (`D`)<br>• Real-time 2D/3D plots & whiteboard overlay | React, XY Flow, Plotly |
| **API Layer** | Data Transport | • Bidirectional WebSocket telemetry streaming<br>• REST endpoints for execution & diagnostics | WebSockets, FastAPI |
| **Backend Server** | Execution & Hardware | • Push/pull hybrid state machine executor<br>• VISA & Serial port lock manager<br>• Virtual Instruments simulation server (SCPI)<br>• Signal processing, NumPy/SciPy math & scripts | Python, PyVISA, NumPy, SciPy |

* **Front-End Canvas & Dashboard**: Runs in modern web browsers (or single-file Desktop app builds). Provides fluid graphical manipulation, auto-layout tools, interactive graph zoom/pan, a digital whiteboard layer, and a dedicated **Operator Dashboard** that displays pinned cards, controls, and monitors in a streamlined control-room layout.
* **Backend Server**: Powered by Python and FastAPI. Handles real-time hardware locks, VISA/SCPI queries, heavy matrix calculations, multi-threaded execution, file persistence, Python virtual environment management, and an automated background simulation server for **Virtual Instruments**.

---

### 1.3 Built-in Safety & Security

* **Instrument Protection & Safety Teardown**: Physical laboratory hardware (lasers, high-voltage power supplies, RF signal sources) requires strict safety management. If a measurement run encounters an error, is manually stopped, or experiences a connection loss, ComfyLAB automatically executes safe shutdown hooks to turn off active outputs and restore instruments to safe states.
* **Blueprint Security Verification**: When opening blueprints from external sources, ComfyLAB runs security checks to prevent unauthorized script execution, giving users full control and prompt verification before running custom code.
* **Secure Remote Access**: ComfyLAB supports secure remote operation over networks using token authentication, allowing researchers to safely monitor and control experiments running on lab computers from remote workstations.
* **In-App Version & Update Checker**: Built-in release manager in the *About* dialog automatically checks for updates on PyPI / GitHub, displaying release notes and allowing one-click upgrades.

### 2.2 Realistic Limitations: What Cannot (or Should Not) Be Done

While ComfyLAB handles almost any scientific measurement, automation, and data processing task, it is helpful to recognize its domain boundary:

* **Hard Real-Time Microsecond Determinism**: ComfyLAB runs on standard OS kernels (Windows/Linux/macOS) via Python/FastAPI backends. It is designed for millisecond-level to sub-second automation loops, sensor sampling, and instrument control. It is **not** intended for bare-metal FPGA hardware logic or hard real-time sub-microsecond control loops (e.g., fast motor drive PWM switching at 100 kHz). For such tasks, hardware FPGAs or dedicated microcontroller RTOS boards should handle low-level timing, while ComfyLAB communicates with them over serial/USB for high-level control, buffering, and plotting.

> **Summary**: Outside of microsecond hardware FPGA determinism, **virtually any scientific measurement, lab automation, data logging, signal analysis, or plotting workflow can be built in ComfyLAB**.

## 3. Comparison with Alternative Paradigms

Understanding how ComfyLAB compares to traditional lab software tools highlights why it is a compelling choice for both teaching and research.

| Feature / Aspect | Pure Python | NI LabVIEW | MATLAB / Simulink | ComfyLAB |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **License & Cost** | Free & Open-Source | Expensive commercial | Expensive commercial | **Free & Open-Source (GPLv3)** |
| **Paradigm** | Text-based script | Proprietary graphical G | Block diagram / script | **Web Block Diagram + Polyglot** |
| **Learning Curve** | High (syntax, APIs) | Steep (G conventions) | Moderate (toolboxes) | **Low (Visual drag-and-drop)** |
| **GUI & Plotting** | Manual (PyQt, Tkinter) | Built-in Front Panel | Built-in Figure windows | **Instant 2D/3D & Dashboard (`D`)** |
| **Offline Simulation** | Manual mock libraries | Basic software mocks | Simulink physics engine | **Built-in SCPI Virtual Instruments** |
| **Files & Versioning** | Plain text `.py` (Git-friendly) | Binary `.vi` (Merge conflicts) | `.m` / Binary `.slx` | **Clean JSON Blueprints (Git-friendly)** |
| **Custom Code** | Native Python | Complex C/Python nodes | S-Functions / MATLAB | **9-Language Script Blocks & DLL/SO** |
| **Architecture** | Monolithic script | Heavy desktop app | Heavy desktop suite | **Decoupled Web UI + FastAPI Server** |
| **Hardware Locks** | Manual implementation | Built-in DAQmx | Instrument Toolbox | **Automatic async VISA lock manager** |

### Key Takeaways:
1. **Vs. Pure Python**: Python is powerful, but creating user interfaces, real-time interactive plots, hardware state loops, and visual workflows requires hundreds of lines of boilerplate code. ComfyLAB keeps Python's full analytical power while providing an immediate visual UI and experiment dashboard.
2. **Vs. LabVIEW**: LabVIEW is widely used but suffers from expensive commercial licenses, heavy proprietary binary files that break version control, and vendor lock-in. ComfyLAB offers a modern, open-source alternative with JSON-based blueprints, built-in virtual instruments, and seamless web browser integration.
3. **Vs. MATLAB**: MATLAB excels at matrix computations but carries heavy licensing costs. ComfyLAB leverages free, open-source NumPy/SciPy backends under the hood.

## 4. Interface Layout & Core Concepts

### 4.1 Interface Layout Overview

The ComfyLAB user interface consists of three primary functional zones surrounded by top controls:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ TOP TOOLBAR: [🟰][⚙️] | [▶ Run/⏸ Pause] [🛑 Stop] | [📊 Dash] │

└────────────────┴──────────────────────────────┴──────────────┘
```

#### Detailed Interface Description:
* **Top Toolbar**: Controls for running (▶️ / `Ctrl+R`), pausing (⏸️), and stopping (🛑 / `Ctrl+Shift+R`) blueprints, opening the **Experiment Dashboard** (📊 / `D`), creating/saving workspace files (`Ctrl+S`), changing color themes, and configuring global VISA settings and diagnostics.
* **Sidebar (Left)**: Searchable palette containing all available built-in blocks, custom published blocks, virtual instrument blocks, and script nodes categorized by domain.
* **Main Canvas (Center)**: Infinite zoomable and pannable visual workspace where you drag, position, and wire functional blocks together.
* **Block Inspector (Right)**: Contextual detail panel that opens when a block is selected. Displays live pin values, block parameters, brief documentation, notes, and execution console logs.
* **Tab Bar & Breadcrumbs**: Navigate between open blueprint files and drill down into sub-canvas clusters.

<div style="page-break-before: always; break-before: page;"></div>
---

### 4.2 Pins & Wires: Execution Flow vs. Data Values

Connections between blocks in ComfyLAB are strictly divided into two distinct categories:

```
  Exec Out  ▶══════════════════════════════▶ Exec In
            (Violet Line: Controls WHEN blocks run)

  Data Out  ●──────────────────────────────● Data In
            (Solid Line: Transfers VALUES on demand)
```

1. **Execution Pins (Flow)**:
   * Represented by **arrow-shaped handles** and connected via **violet lines (🟪)**.
   * Dictate **sequential timing and control flow** (when steps execute, loops repeat, or branches trigger).

2. **Data Pins (Values)**:
   * Represented by **circular colored pins** and connected via **solid colored lines**.
   * Carry **values** (numbers, text strings, NumPy vectors, dictionaries, hardware handles).
   * Evaluated lazily on demand when an execution block requests input data.

#### Data Pin Color Reference:
* 🟧 **Number (Orange)**: Scalar integer or floating-point numerical values.
* 🟩 **Boolean (Green)**: Logical `True` or `False` flags.
* 🟪 **String (Pink)**: Text strings, formatted characters, or SCPI commands.
* 🟨 **Array (Yellow)**: High-performance 1D or 2D NumPy numerical arrays/vectors.
* 🟦 **List (Cyan)**: Ordered collections of elements.
* 🟫 **Dictionary (Brown)**: Key-value parameter mappings.

---

### 4.3 Execution Logic & Independent Chains
* **Execution Trigger**: Clicking **Run Blueprint** (▶️ or `Ctrl+R`) starts execution at entry blocks (blocks with no incoming execution connections) and follows execution wires downstream.
* **Independent Execution Chains**: If the canvas contains separate, unconnected block groups, ComfyLAB automatically treats them as parallel execution chains, allowing independent acquisition loops to run concurrently.
* **Control Flow & Timing Blocks**:
  * **For Loop**: Executes a sub-loop for a specified iteration count, outputting current index, completion percentage (`%`), and estimated time remaining (`ETR`).
  * **For Each Loop**: Iterates through each item in a list or array, providing item, index, percentage, and ETR outputs.
  * **While Loop**: Continually executes a sub-loop while a Boolean condition pin remains `True`.
  * **If / Else Branch**: Routes execution flow to either a `True` or `False` output path based on a condition.
  * **Delay / Sleep**: Pauses execution flow for a specified duration (ms or seconds).
  * **Countdown Wait**: Pauses execution for a specified duration with an active live countdown clock, draining progress bar, and interactive **Skip Wait** button.
  * **Progress Bar**: Standalone visual display widget for tracking live completion percentage (0–100%).
  * **ETR Display**: Mission-control digital readout for estimating and rendering remaining run durations (`HH:MM:SS` or `MM:SS`).
  * **Execution Timer (Measure Time)**: Measures exact wall-clock elapsed time between trigger pulses.

---

### 4.4 Advanced Features

* **Experiment Dashboard & Pinned Cards (📊 / `D`)**: The Dashboard provides a clean, distraction-free "operator cockpit" for running experiments, presenting results, or conducting practical lab work without the visual complexity of block diagrams and wires.
  * **Pinning Blocks**: Any block or pin can be pinned to the Dashboard. Right-click a block and select **Pin to Dashboard**, click the pin icon in the Block Inspector header, or use the card pin icon on supported widgets.
  * **Automatic Organization**: Inputs, sliders, and constants are organized into interactive **Control Cards**, while graphs, gauges, indicators, and timers become dedicated **Monitor Cards**.
  * **Layout Customization**: Reorder cards up/down, drag corners to resize plots, toggle card controls, or click the jump icon to instantly navigate back to the corresponding canvas block.
  * **Maximized View**: Maximize the dashboard panel to fill the workspace for a streamlined full-screen lab control station.
* **Persistent Blocks (📌)**: By default, block states reset between execution runs. Marking a block as **Persistent** preserves its internal state and hardware handles (e.g., active VISA connections, open serial ports, or running averages) across multiple blueprint runs.
* **Disabling Blocks (🚫)**: Right-clicking a block to disable it dims the block on canvas. Disabled blocks are bypassed during execution, passing data through cleanly without running code—ideal for testing workflows without physical hardware.
* **Clusters (Sub-canvases 📦)**: Group complex block arrangements into a single custom block. Double-clicking a cluster block opens an isolated sub-canvas, with top breadcrumbs for navigation.
* **Whiteboard Mode (🎨)**: Click the tool icon or press hotkey `4` to toggle drawing mode, allowing freehand ink notes, text boxes, and shapes to be added directly over the canvas.

### Tutorial 5: VISA Hardware Interfacing (SCPI Identification Query)
**Goal**: Connect to a physical or simulated instrument over VISA using `VISA Device`, send an SCPI `*IDN?` query using `VISA Query`, and display the instrument model response.

```
┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐
│ VISA Device  │▶───▶│ VISA Query   ├──► Response: "*IDN?..."
│ Address: ... ├────▶│ Command:*IDN?│
└──────────────┘     └──────────────┘
```

#### Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. Drag a **VISA Device** block (under *VISA / Core*) onto the canvas. Set the `Address` parameter to your instrument address (e.g. `TCPIP0::192.168.1.100::INSTR`, `GPIB0::14::INSTR`, `COM3`, or `VIRT::OSC`).
2. Drag a **VISA Query** block (under *VISA / Core*) onto the canvas.
3. Connect the `Out` execution pin of VISA Device to the `In` execution pin of VISA Query.
4. Connect the `Device` handle output pin (cyan pin) from VISA Device to the `Device` input pin of VISA Query.
5. Set the `Command` parameter in VISA Query to `*IDN?`.
6. Click **Run Blueprint** (▶️ or `Ctrl+R`). (ComfyLAB automatically manages connection caching, locks, and safe teardown).
7. **Verification**: Click the **VISA Query** block and check the Block Inspector. The `Response` output pin displays the instrument identification string (e.g. `HEWLETT-PACKARD,34401A,0,11-5-2` or `KEYSIGHT TECHNOLOGIES,DSOX2002A,...`).
8. **Tip**: You can also use the **VISA Resource Manager** block to discover connected physical instruments automatically!

### Tutorial 6: Offline Automation with Built-in Virtual Instruments
**Goal**: Connect to ComfyLAB's embedded virtual instruments, configure a simulated signal generator, capture a waveform with the virtual oscilloscope, and monitor the results on the Dashboard without any physical hardware.

```

#### Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. From the Sidebar, navigate to **Devices > Virtual**.
2. Drag a **VirtSigGen Connect** block and a **VirtSigGen Config Wave** block. Connect them to generate a 1.0 kHz sine wave at 2.0 Vpp.
3. Drag a **VirtOsc Connect** block and a **VirtOsc Acquire** block. Connect the execution flow and the device handles.
4. Drag an **XY Plot** block. Connect the oscilloscope's time array output to **X** and the voltage trace array to **Y**.
5. Right-click the **XY Plot** block and select **Pin to Dashboard**.
6. Press `D` on your keyboard (or click **Dashboard** in the top toolbar) to open the Operator Dashboard panel.
7. Click **Run Blueprint** (▶️ or `Ctrl+R`).
8. **Verification**: ComfyLAB will automatically spawn the background virtual instrument simulation server. The Operator Dashboard will immediately display the live captured waveform. You can also load the pre-built **Bode Diagram Virtual** workflow from **File Menu > Load Example > Bode_Diagram_Virtual.json** to see a full automated frequency sweep with Bode plots!
